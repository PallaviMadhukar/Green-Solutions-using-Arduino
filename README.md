# Green-Solutions-using-Arduino
Course taken for 25 undergrads as a Teaching Fellow at PES University, Bangalore, India

## [Module 1](/Module%201)

#### 1. [Video](/Module%201/Module1%20video.mp4)

#### 2. [Components needed for this course](/Module%201/Components%20required.xlsx)

#### 3. [Assignment 1](/Module%201/Assignments/Assignment%201.docx)

Notice an issue around you in your college/home/neighbourhood. Understand the problem and why it happens. Come up with a solution(preferably tech-based).

#### 4. [Learn about Arduino circuit boards](/Module%201/Arduino%20UNO%20circuit%20board.pptx)

With a focus on Arduino UNO

#### 5. [Install the Arduino IDE](/Module%201/Installing%20IDE.html)

#### 6. [Arduino IDE syntax](/Module%201/Syntax.pptx)

Important concepts include formatting, setup() and loop() functions, input-output declarations, pin levels, serial port

#### 7. [Learn how to use libraries](/Module%201/Using%20libraries.mov)

#### 8. [Brief glance at sensors](/Module%201/Sensors.pptx)

Use, components, types of sensors

#### 9. [Overview on soil moisture sensor](/Module%201/Soil%20moisture%20sensor.docx)

Working, specifications, use case, connections, troubleshooting of Soil moisture sensor interfacing with Arduino IDE

#### 10. [Code for soil moisture sensor interfacing with Arduino IDE](/Module%201/SoilCode)

#### 11. [Assignment 2](/Module%201/Assignments/Assignment%202.docx)

Submit a working video of the soil moisture sensor.

#### 12. [Assignment 3](/Module%201/Assignments/Assignment%203.docx)

Add to the code and find the percentage of moisture.

#### 13. [Working towards the capstone](/Module%201/Working%20towards%20the%20capstone.docx)

The soil moisture sensor can be used to solve various issues. This need not be related to soil, for e.g. it can be integrated in dustbins for dry/wet waste segregation. It can also have a dual purpose, for e.g. automatic irrigation saves water, energy and ensures healthy growth by providing ideal supply. Think of ways the soil moisture sensor can solve a problem we face under the three issues- water, waste, energy.

#### 10. [Overview on ultrasonic sensor](/Module%202/Ultrasonic%20sensor.docx)

Working, specifications, use case, connections, troubleshooting of ultrasonic sensor interfacing with Arduino IDE

#### 11. [Code for ultrasonic sensor interfacing with Arduino IDE - without library](/Module%202/Distance_Sensor)

#### 12. [Code for ultrasonic sensor interfacing with Arduino IDE - with library](/Module%202/Distance_if_led)

#### 13. [Assignment 5](/Module%202/Assignments/Assignment%205.docx)

Submit a working video of the ultrasonic sensor.

#### 14. [Working towards the capstone](/Module%202/Working%20towards%20the%20capstone.docx)

Like in the last module where we found various issues that the soil mosture could solve, think of ways the sensors we worked with in this module can solve a problem we face under the three issues- water, waste, energy.

Pick one of the solutions that you would like to work with.
